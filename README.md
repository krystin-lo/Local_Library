# Local Library Project
The Local Library is a fully-functional web application that allows librarians to keep track of books and borrowers.This project demonstrates my knowledge and proficiency in developing RESTful APIs, creating and querying a database using MongoDB, and building user interfaces using HTML and CSS.
In this project, I have also utilized advanced features of Node.js and Express, such as middleware, routing, and template engines. The application has also been deployed to Heroku, which showcases my ability to handle the deployment process.
