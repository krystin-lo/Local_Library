# Local Library Project
The local_library project on GitHub is a web application that serves as a library management system. It is built using the node.js web framework in Javascript.

The application allows librarians to manage the books in their library, including adding, updating, and deleting books, as well as keeping track of their availability and loan status. Users can also search for books in the library, view their details, and make reservations for them.

The project implements user authentication and authorization, allowing librarians to log in and perform administrative tasks, while regular users can view books and make reservations without logging in.

The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, with some dynamic elements using JavaScript and jQuery. The back-end incorporates the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with a PostgreSQL database.

Overall, this project demonstrates the full-stack development skills of the author, including proficiency in node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and database management. The project also highlights the ability to implement complex functionality and manage user authentication and authorization.
